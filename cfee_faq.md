## What is the difference between Cloud Foundry Enterprise Edition (CFEE) and public Cloud Foundry?
{: #cfee_diff}

You can use IBM Cloud Foundry public to run cloud-native applications that are using Cloud Foundry for simple setup, powerful scaling, and traffic management. You also have easy access to all {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} services.

You can use IBM Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment for everything as you would with Cloud Foundry Public, but also to create and manage isolated environments for hosting Cloud Foundry applications exclusively for your enterprise.
