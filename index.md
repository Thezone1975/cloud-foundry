For a successful project, take time to plan and design which resources you need and what your enterprise requirements are. To help you get started, consider the following questions:

* How many, and what type of, apps are you developing?
* Which services do the apps need to access?
* Who collaborates in the development process and what role do they play?
* What degree of isolation is required for each phase of the project?
* Does your enterprise supply the infrastructure resources?
* How does your company communicate?
* Is there a naming standard that you can implement to clearly identify the organization and space usage?
