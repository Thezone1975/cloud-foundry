# About {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}}
{: #about}

With the {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full}} (CFEE), you can instantiate multiple, isolated, enterprise-grade Cloud Foundry platforms on demand. Instances of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Foundry Enterprise service run within your own account in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The environment is deployed on isolated hardware (Kubernetes clusters). You have full control over the environment, including access control, capacity management, change management, monitoring, and services.
{:shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.cfee_full}} is currently in its beta phase and we are looking for feedback! To get started, create your own instance of {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full}} at [https://console.bluemix.net/cfadmin/create](https://console.bluemix.net/cfadmin/create) and [request access](http://ibm.biz/cfee-forum-signup) to the [IBM CFEE Slack forum](https://ibm-cfee.slack.com) to share your feedback, ask questions, and engage with the product team.
{:tip}

For a successful project, take time to plan and design which resources you need and what your enterprise requirements are. To help you get started, consider the following questions:

* How many, and what type of, apps are you developing?
* Which services do the apps need to access?
* Who collaborates in the development process and what role do they play?
* What degree of isolation is required for each phase of the project?
* Does your enterprise supply the infrastructure resources?
* How does your company communicate?
* Is there a naming standard that you can implement to clearly identify the organization and space usage?

As part of deciding which type of cloud environment you need, plan the structure of your account, organizations, spaces, resources, and team members.

A single {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account is sufficient for most organizations. If your organization has more than one business area, you can create a separate {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account for each business domain, for example, a large banking corporation might create separate accounts for the retail and commercial sectors.

The following table provides a summary of some of the key elements.

| Element   | Description |
|-----------|---------------|
| IBM Cloud Account | CFEE instances are created under a specific IBM Cloud account, making it available to users in that account according to the roles and access policies defined for those users. |
|| The account under which CFEE instances are created must be Pay-As-You-Go or a Subscription account type (not a Trial account).  |
| CFEE | IBM Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment service for hosting applications. |
|| Is available in the IBM Cloud catalog. |
| CFEE instance | An instance of the IBM Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment service created under an IBM Cloud account by a user in with an administrator or editor role in that account. |
|| There can be multiple CFEE instances in an IBM Cloud Account. |
|| Can have one or more organizations. |
| Organization | Includes one or more spaces. |
|| Includes one or more org managers. |
|| Includes one or more team members. Each team member can be granted one or more roles. |
|| The usage charges, which are generated by a deployed application within a space, are reported at the organization level. |
| Space | Includes one or more resources. |
|| Includes one or more apps. |
|| Includes one or more space managers. |
|| Includes one or more team members. Each user must already be a team member in the owning organization. Each team member can be granted one or more roles. |
| Team member | Can be added to one or more organizations and spaces across different accounts. |
|| Can be given more than one role within the same organization, space, or both. |
| Service alias | An alias of a service instance in the IBM Cloud. |
|| Allows developers to bind existing service instances available in their IBM Cloud account to their applications deployed in a space within a CFEE.|

For **example**, the CFEE service can provisioned in three data centers in Europe: Amsterdam (1 data center), Frankfurt (3 data centers), London (3 data centers), Oslo (1 data center), and Paris (1 data center). If the CFEE is provisioned in Frankfurt, the Cloud Object Store service instance will be deployed in the _eu-geo_ region, and the Compose for PostgreSQL service instance will be deployed in the _eu-de_ public Cloud Foundry region.
