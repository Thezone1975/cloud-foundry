# Managing change
{: #managing-change}

During the life-cycle of a {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}} ({{site.data.keyword.cfee_short}}) instance there is a shared responsibility between 
the customer and IBM to apply changes.

The customer will notice available updates in the IBM Cloud console. The customer can implement the changes as described
[here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry?topic=cloud-foundry-update-scale#update-scale).

Various considerations need to be taken into account based on the customers procedures for change management.
For instance:

- determination of appropriate change windows
- installation of prerequisites 
- installation of changes
- verification of successful changes
- customer-specific considerations
